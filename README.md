# ssd-for-torch
thanks for [mks0601](https://github.com/mks0601/SSD-Single-Shot-MultiBox-Detector) code and now this code is not finished. 
I modify this code for two aspects:
1. modify dataset loader on VOC0712 trainval, VOC2007 trainval and VOC2012 trainval.
2. train 300 x 300 model as orginal paper said.
3. maybe I trained 500 x 500 model later.
4. add wider face dataset loading for ssd model training.
